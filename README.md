## Keras-GAN
Collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers. These models are in some cases simplified versions of the ones ultimately described in the papers, but I have chosen to focus on getting the core ideas covered instead of getting every layer configuration right. Contributions and suggestions of GAN varieties to implement are very welcomed.

## Installation

To install without an environment, use:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/h3dema/Keras-GAN.git
    $ cd Keras-GAN/
    $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To use virtualenv or anaconda, please refer to how to enable the environment in their documentation.
The commands to clone and install are the same as above.


## Running the code

The code is in the folder indicated above.

```
$ cd Keras-GAN/
$ jupyter notebook
```

In the web page that jupyter opens, you can browser each folder, and run the notebook.
